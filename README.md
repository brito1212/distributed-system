# Distributed Systems Laboratory Repository

Welcome to the Distributed Systems Laboratory repository! This repository is dedicated to storing the code and materials related to various lab activities in the field of distributed systems. Each folder corresponds to a specific lab class, focusing on different distributed systems architectures, communication protocols, and implementations using Java.

## Lab Classes

### Lab Class 1: Introduction to Distributed Systems

Description: This lab class provides an introduction to distributed systems, covering basic concepts, challenges, and communication models.

- Folder: `Lab1`
- Files: `client.java`, `server.java`

### Lab Class 2: Client-Server Architecture with Clock type

Description: In this lab class, you'll explore the client-server architecture and implement basic communication between clients and servers.

- Folder: `Lab2-Clck`
- Package: `lab2`
- Files: `Clock.java`, `ClockClient.java`, `ClockImpl.java`, `ClockServer.java`
